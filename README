NAME
    HTTP::BrowserDetect - Determine Web browser, version, and platform from
    an HTTP user agent string

VERSION
    version 1.74

SYNOPSIS
        use HTTP::BrowserDetect;

        my $browser = HTTP::BrowserDetect->new($user_agent_string);

        # Detect operating system
        if ($browser->windows) {
          if ($browser->winnt) ...
          if ($browser->win95) ...
        }
        print $browser->mac;

        # Detect browser vendor and version
        print $browser->netscape;
        print $browser->ie;
        if (browser->major(4)) {
        if ($browser->minor() > .5) {
            ...
        }
        }
        if ($browser->version() > 4) {
          ...;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    The HTTP::BrowserDetect object does a number of tests on an HTTP user
    agent string. The results of these tests are available via methods of
    the object.

    This module is based upon the JavaScript browser detection code
    available at
    <http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/sniffer/browser_type.html>.

CONSTRUCTOR AND STARTUP
  new()
        HTTP::BrowserDetect->new( $user_agent_string )

    The constructor may be called with a user agent string specified.
    Otherwise, it will use the value specified by $ENV{'HTTP_USER_AGENT'},
    which is set by the web server when calling a CGI script.

    You may also use a non-object-oriented interface. For each method, you
    may call HTTP::BrowserDetect::method_name(). You will then be working
    with a default HTTP::BrowserDetect object that is created behind the
    scenes.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  user_agent()
    Returns the value of the user agent string.

    Calling this method with a parameter has now been deprecated and this
    feature will be removed in an upcoming release.

  country()
    Returns the country string as it may be found in the user agent string.
    This will be in the form of an upper case 2 character code. ie: US, DE,
    etc

  language()
    Returns the language string as it is found in the user agent string.
    This will be in the form of an upper case 2 character code. ie: EN, DE,
    etc

  device()
    Returns the method name of the actual hardware, if it can be detected.
    Currently returns one of: android, audrey, blackberry, dsi, iopener,
    ipad, iphone, ipod, kindle, n3ds, palm, ps3, psp, wap, webos. Returns
    "undef" if no hardware can be detected

  device_name()
    Returns a human formatted version of the hardware device name. These
    names are subject to change and are really meant for display purposes.
    You should use the device() method in your logic. Returns one of:
    Android, Audrey, BlackBerry, Nintendo DSi, iopener, iPad, iPhone, iPod,
    Amazon Kindle, Nintendo 3DS, Palm, Sony PlayStation 3, Sony Playstation
    Portable, WAP capable phone, webOS. Also Windows-based smartphones will
    output various different names like HTC T7575. Returns "undef" if this
    is not a device or if no device name can be detected.

  browser_properties()
    Returns a list of the browser properties, that is, all of the tests that
    passed for the provided user_agent string. Operating systems, devices,
    browser names, mobile and robots are all browser properties.

Detecting Browser Version
    Please note that that the version(), major() and minor() methods have
    been superceded as of release 1.07 of this module. They are not yet
    deprecated, but should be replaced with public_version(), public_major()
    and public_minor() in new development.

    The reasoning behind this is that version() method will, in the case of
    Safari, return the Safari/XXX numbers even when Version/XXX numbers are
    present in the UserAgent string. Because this behaviour has been in
    place for so long, some clients may have come to rely upon it. So, it
    has been retained in the interest of "bugwards compatibility", but in
    almost all cases, the numbers returned by public_version(),
    public_major() and public_minor() will be what you are looking for.

  public_version()
    Returns the browser version as a floating-point number.

  public_major()
    Returns the integer portion of the browser version.

  public_minor()
    Returns the decimal portion of the browser version as a floating-point
    number less than 1. For example, if the version is 4.05, this method
    returns .05; if the version is 4.5, this method returns .5.

    On occasion a version may have more than one decimal point, such as
    'Wget/1.4.5'. The minor version does not include the second decimal
    point, or any further digits or decimals.

  version($version)
    Returns the version as a floating-point number. If passed a parameter,
    returns true if it is equal to the version specified by the user agent
    string.

  major($major)
    Returns the integer portion of the browser version. If passed a
    parameter, returns true if it equals the browser major version.

  minor($minor)
    Returns the decimal portion of the browser version as a floating-point
    number less than 1. For example, if the version is 4.05, this method
    returns .05; if the version is 4.5, this method returns .5. This is a
    change in behavior from previous versions of this module, which returned
    a string.

    If passed a parameter, returns true if equals the minor version.

    On occasion a version may have more than one decimal point, such as
    'Wget/1.4.5'. The minor version does not include the second decimal
    point, or any further digits or decimals.

  beta($beta)
    Returns any the beta version, consisting of any non-numeric characters
    after the version number. For instance, if the user agent string is
    'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0b2; Windows NT)', returns 'b2'. If
    passed a parameter, returns true if equal to the beta version. If the
    beta starts with a dot, it is thrown away.

Detecting Rendering Engine
  engine_string()
    Returns one of the following:

    Gecko, KHTML, Trident, MSIE, NetFront

    Returns "undef" if no string can be found.

  engine_version()
    Returns the version number of the rendering engine. Currently this only
    returns a version number for Gecko and Trident. Returns "undef" for all
    other engines. The output is simply "engine_major" added with
    "engine_minor".

  engine_major()
    Returns the major version number of the rendering engine. Currently this
    only returns a version number for Gecko and Trident. Returns "undef" for
    all other engines.

  engine_minor()
    Returns the minor version number of the rendering engine. Currently this
    only returns a version number for Gecko and Trident. Returns "undef" for
    all other engines.

Detecting OS Platform and Version
    The following methods are available, each returning a true or false
    value. Some methods also test for the operating system version. The
    indentations below show the hierarchy of tests (for example, win2k is
    considered a type of winnt, which is a type of win32)

  windows()
        win16 win3x win31
        win32
            winme win95 win98
            winnt
                win2k winxp win2k3 winvista win7
                win8
                    win8_0 win8_1
        wince
        winphone
            winphone7 winphone7_5 winphone8

  dotnet()
  firefoxos()
  mac()

      sun sun4 sun5 suni86 irix irix5 irix6 hpux hpux9 hpux10
      aix aix1 aix2 aix3 aix4 linux sco unixware mpras reliant
      dec sinix freebsd bsd

  vms()
  amiga()
  ps3gameos()
  pspgameos()
    It may not be possibile to detect Win98 in Netscape 4.x and earlier. On
    Opera 3.0, the userAgent string includes "Windows 95/NT4" on all Win32,
    so you can't distinguish between Win95 and WinNT.

  os_string()
    Returns one of the following strings, or undef. This method exists
    solely for compatibility with the HTTP::Headers::UserAgent module.

      Win95, Win98, WinNT, Win2K, WinXP, Win2k3, WinVista, Win7, Win8,
      Win8.1, Windows Phone, Mac, Mac OS X, iOS, Win3x, OS2, Unix, Linux,
      Firefox OS, Playstation 3 GameOS, Playstation Portable GameOS,
      RIM Tablet OS, BlackBerry 10

Detecting Browser Vendor
    The following methods are available, each returning a true or false
    value. Some methods also test for the browser version, saving you from
    checking the version separately.

   aol aol3 aol4 aol5 aol6
   chrome
   curl
   emacs
   firefox
   gecko
   icab
   ie ie3 ie4 ie4up ie5 ie55 ie6 ie7 ie8 ie9 ie10 ie11
   ie_compat_mode
    The ie_compat_mode is used to determine if the IE user agent is for the
    compatibility mode view, in which case the real version of IE is higher
    than that detected. The true version of IE can be inferred from the
    version of Trident in the engine_version method.

   java
   konqueror
   lotusnotes
   lynx links elinks
   mobile_safari
   mosaic
   mozilla
   neoplanet neoplanet2
   netfront
   netscape nav2 nav3 nav4 nav4up nav45 nav45up navgold nav6 nav6up
   opera opera3 opera4 opera5 opera6 opera7
   realplayer
   realplayer_browser
    The realplayer method above tests for the presence of either the
    RealPlayer plug-in "(r1 " or the browser "RealPlayer". To preserve
    "bugwards compatibility" and prevent false reporting, browser_string
    calls this method which ignores the "(r1 " plug-in signature.

   safari
   staroffice
   webtv
    Netscape 6, even though its called six, in the User-Agent string has
    version number 5. The nav6 and nav6up methods correctly handle this
    quirk. The Firefox test correctly detects the older-named versions of
    the browser (Phoenix, Firebird).

  browser_string()
    Returns undef on failure. Otherwise returns one of the following:

    Netscape, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, MSIE, WebTV, AOL Browser, Opera,
    Mosaic, Lynx, Links, ELinks, RealPlayer, IceWeasel, curl, puf, NetFront,
    Mobile Safari, BlackBerry.

  gecko_version()
    If a Gecko rendering engine is used (as in Mozilla or Firefox), returns
    the version of the renderer (e.g. 1.3a, 1.7, 1.8) This might be more
    useful than the particular browser name or version when correcting for
    quirks in different versions of this rendering engine. If no Gecko
    browser is being used, or the version number can't be detected, returns
    undef.

Detecting Other Devices
    The following methods are available, each returning a true or false
    value.

   android
   audrey
   avantgo
   blackberry
   dsi
   iopener
   iphone
   ipod
   ipad
   kindle
   n3ds
   obigo
   palm
   webos
   wap
   psp
   ps3
  mobile()
    Returns true if the browser appears to belong to a handheld device.

  tablet()
    Returns true if the browser appears to belong to a tablet device.

  robot()
    Returns true if the user agent appears to be a robot, spider, crawler,
    or other automated Web client.

    The following additional methods are available, each returning a true or
    false value. This is by no means a complete list of robots that exist on
    the Web.

   ahrefs
   altavista
   askjeeves
   baidu
   facebook
   getright
   google
   googleadsbot
   googleadsense

   linkexchange
   lwp
   lycos
   mj12bot
   msn (same as bing)
   puf
   slurp
   webcrawler
   wget
   yahoo
   yandex

TO DO
    The "_engine()" method currently only handles Gecko and Trident. It
    needs to be expanded to handle other rendering engines.

    POD coverage is also not 100%.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    The biggest limitation at this point is the test suite, which really
    needs to have many more UserAgent strings to test against.

CONTRIBUTING
    Patches are certainly welcome, with many thanks for the excellent
    contributions which have already been received. The preferred method of
    patching would be to fork the GitHub repo and then send me a pull
    request, but plain old patch files are also welcome.

    If you're able to add test cases, this will speed up the time to release
    your changes. Just edit t/useragents.json so that the test coverage
    includes any changes you have made. Please contact me if you have any
